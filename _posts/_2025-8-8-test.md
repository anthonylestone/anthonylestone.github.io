When we talk about "scattering" in physics, we're pretty much talking about all
circumstances where a particle interacts with a potential in a way that causes
it to change trajectory.

<link rel="stylesheet"
      href="{{ '/assets/css/scattering/particle.css' | relative_url }}">

<div id="particle-window" class="particle-window"
     style="width:600px; height:200px;"></div>

<script type="module">
  import { initParticleLoop }
    from "{{ '/assets/js/scattering/particle.js' | relative_url }}";

  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    initParticleLoop('#particle-window');
  });
</script>
