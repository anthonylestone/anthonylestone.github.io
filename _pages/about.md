Welcome to my website, where you can find a selection of [projects](/projects/) that I have worked on.

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Nuclear Physics at Texas A&M University, working under [Dr. Grigory Rogachev.](https://artsci.tamu.edu/physics-astronomy/contact/profiles/grigory-rogachev.html)

See some of my past research featured in Physical Review Letters [here](https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.061901).
