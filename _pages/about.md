<b><big>Howdy!</big><b>

I am a Nuclear Physics PhD student at Texas A&M University Cyclotron Institute,
working under [Dr.  Grigory
Rogachev](https://artsci.tamu.edu/physics-astronomy/contact/profiles/grigory-rogachev.html).


As an undergraudate, I spent two summers at Los Alamos National Laboratory with
Dr. Matt Durham. There, my primary focus was the analysis of high energy
proton-proton collision data from the LHCb collaboration, while also gaining
hands-on experience assembling experimental hardware in the lab.

Later in my undergraduate studies, I began working with the Texas A&M Cyclotron Institute,
where my interests shifted towards low-energy experimental nuclear physics. After 
earning my B.S. in Physics, I began my PhD at Texas A&M in August 2024. 

I am now primarily involved in nuclear fission research, with the goal of measuring
fission cross sections that are difficult to access directly using a technique known
as the *surrogate reaction method.*
