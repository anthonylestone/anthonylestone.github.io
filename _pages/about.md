<b><big>Howdy!</big><b>

I am an undergraduate at Texas A&M University, expecting to graduate in August 2024. I am currently pursuing a BS in Physics with minors in Mathematics and Computer Science. Here you can find a selection of [projects](/projects/) that I have worked on.

See my research featured in Physical Review Letters [here](https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.061901).
