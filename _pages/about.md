Welcome to my website, where you can find a selection of [projects](/projects/) that I have worked on.

I am an undergraduate at Texas A&M University, expecting to graduate in August 2024. I am currently pursuing a BS in Physics with minors in Mathematics and Computer Science. I will be beginning my PhD in Nuclear Physics at Texas A&M in Fall 2024. 

See my research featured in Physical Review Letters [here](https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.061901).
