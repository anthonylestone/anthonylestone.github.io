<b><big>Summer 2023</big><b>

[Team Meeting 6/26/2023](/assets/pdf/TeamMeeting-6_26_2023.pdf)
Effect of spacing between target and silicon detector on the ability to discern protons and deuterons by deposition depth.

[Team Meeting 7/17/2023](/assets/pdf/TeamMeeting-7_17_2023.pdf)
Testing pulse shape discrimination on some old 7Be on 6Li data. Discrimination between protons and other particles is demonstrated. 

[Team Meeting 7/28/2023](/assets/pdf/TeamMeeting-7_28_2023.pdf)
Dead layers of the front (junction) and rear (ohmic) sides of MSD026-1500 silicon detector are measured. They are found to be 500nm, which is in agreement with the parts sheet.

<b><big>Fall 2023</big><b>

[Team Meeting 9/15/2023](/assets/pdf/TeamMeeting-9_15_2023.pdf)
Shows Marina's results for rise time at different energies and bias voltages. Shows the poor discrimination from Imax at 8 MeV.
