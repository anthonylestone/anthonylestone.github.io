Research conducted under [Grigory Rogachev](https://physics.tamu.edu/directory/rogachev/) and [Marina Barbui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marina-barbui-7a903130/).

This presentation was given as part of the Cylcotron Insitute Brown Bag Luncheon lecture series.

Pulse shape discrimination (PSD) is a technique used to differentiate between different types of particles in a detector. PSD is usually done using specialized neutron transmutation doped (NTD) silicon detectors, but this project demonstrates that good proton-deuteron separation can be achieved above 6 MeV using an ordinary silicon detector.
